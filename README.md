## Quickstart
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone or download the repository
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory
4. Install dependencies `npm install`
5. Edit `src/config/config.sample.js` and rename to `config.js`

(**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**) Build and run the application in _**Production Mode**_

* Build `npm run build` then `npm run serve`

If you are a developer or want to debug go into _**Development Mode**_

* Start `npm start`

---

## Configuration
A configuration file can be found in `./src/config/config.sample.js`. Configure all settings as you desire and rename the file to `config.js`. If you are running in the production environment you will have to rebuild with `npm run build` everytime you change something in the configuration file.

### Connecting to Twitch Chat
To be able to connect to Twitch chat, you have to register an application and get an OAuth token with the correct scopes. You will also have to specify at least one channel. Please keep in mind that you need custom alerts for each channel if you have `enableCustomMessages: true`.

* Register an application on Twitch [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/dashboard/apps/create) and copy the clientId
* Login to the Twitch account to be used and get an [OAuth token](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

```javascript
clientId: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
username: 'd0p3tbot',
token: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
channels: ['#d0p3t', '#summit1g', '#ninja'],
```
### Configure Chat Messages
There are three types of chat notifiers, we call them Chat Alerts.

* subscriptions
* resubscriptions
* bits

You can use as many custom chat alerts as you wish. If you activate custom chat alerts, you **MUST** set at least 1 custom chat alert per type and channel. If custom alerts are not enabled, it will default to predefined messages.

Within the chat alerts you can use various variables. Below is a list of available variables with a description and where you can use them.

| Variable        | Description           | Uses  |
|---------------|-------------|-----|
| {{username}}    | Displays the username of the (re)subscriber/cheerer | subscriptions, resubscriptions, bits |
| {{months}}      | Number of months resubscribed      | resubscriptions |
| {{years}}       | Displays # years if 1 year or more (as `[ X year(s) and X month(s) ]`) | resubscriptions |
| {{bits}}        | Amount of bits cheered | bits |
| {{message}}        | Message sent with event | subscriptions, resubscriptions, bits |
| {{recipient}}   | Recipient of a giften subscription  | gifted subscriptions  |

```javascript
'#d0p3t': {
  subscriptions: {
    custom1: 'PogChamp SUB Thank you for subscribing {{username}}',
    custom2: 'CoolStoryBob SUB Thank you for subscribing {{username}}',
    custom3: 'DansGame SUB Thank you for subscribing {{username}}' },
  giftsubscriptions: {
    custom1: 'PogChamp SUB Thank you for gifting {{recipient}} a subscription, {{username}}',
    custom2: 'CoolStoryBob SUB Thank you for gifting {{recipient}} a subscription, {{username}}',
    custom3: 'DansGame SUB Thank you for gifting {{recipient}} a subscription, {{username}}' },    
  resubscriptions: {
    custom1: 'PogChamp RESUB Thank you {{username}} for resubscribing for {{months}} months! {{years}} {{message}}',
    custom2: 'WutFace RESUB Thank you {{username}} for resubscribing for {{months}} months! {{years}}',
    custom3: '<3 RESUB Thank you {{username}} for resubscribing for {{months}} months! {{years}}' },
  bits: {
    custom1: 'Wowzers, {{username}} cheered {{bits}} BITS!',
    custom2: 'Oh so kind, {{username}} with the {{bits}} BITS!',
    custom3: 'LUL we got a happy cheerer over here ({{username}}: {{bits}} bits)!' },
},
```

### Enable/Disable Features
There also various settings that you can enable (true) or disable (false).

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| enableDebug | Enables debugMode for extra console output | false |
| enableSecureMode | Connects to Twitch chat with SSL (443) | true |
| enableMeMode | Chat alerts start with */me* | true |
| enableSubAlerts | Enables subscription chat notifications | true |
| enableGiftSubAlerts | Enabled gift subscription chat notifications | true |
| enableResubAlerts | Enables resubscriptions chat notifications | true |
| enableBitAlerts | Enables bits chat notifcations | false |
| enableCustomMessages | Enables custom chat alerts | true |



If you've configured everything correctly, you will now be able to start *SubNotifier* and upon a successful connection will see `CONNECTED: Waiting for events...`. If you are still having issues, please refer to the sample configuration file first and then open an issue (see below).

---

## Issues
If you have any issues or questions, open an issue or tweet me [@d0p3t](https://twitter.com/d0p3t).

For configuration file problems, please first check whether your syntax is correct and you aren't missing any commas or brackets. SubNotifier has a failsafe against missing custom messages, but will not revert to the defaults if `enableCustomMessages: true` and there is a problem with the configuration file.

## Thank You!
Thank you to the creators and maintainers of [twitch-js](https://github.com/twitch-apis/twitch-js) for providing easy access to TwitchNotify events and Twitch Chat.

Also a great thank you to [Ikatzuki](https://twitter.com/lolIkatzuki) and [dinu](https://twitter.com/dinuDB) for discussing and coming up with new features. Without you SubNotifier wouldn't have improved as it did now.
